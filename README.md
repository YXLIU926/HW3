### Hong Kong Hotel Recommender App
This recommender app I built will be able to take in tourist attraction names in Hong Kong, and recommends hotels based on these places. I first made use of SpaCy to remove stopwords from the previous hotel reviews and grouped all reviews that belonged to the same hotel together. I then made use of cosine similarity to output recommendations based on the input features. Each recommendation also has its score, the higher the better.
